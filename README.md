# Coursera-Robotics-Estimation-and-Learning
My assignment of Robotics: Estimation and Learning on Coursera.

## Honor Code
please DO NOT refer any code in my repo before the due date and NEVER post any code in my repo according to "Stanford Honer Code" below. Questions or pointing out is always welcome, please send me a mail.

More information of Coursera Honor Code, visit [the link here](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).

## Attentions
Assigment "Particle Filter Based Localization" still has problems. When the robot move to the long hall, due to the high similarity of measurements of different positions at the long hall, the code will fail to find the right pose of the robot.
